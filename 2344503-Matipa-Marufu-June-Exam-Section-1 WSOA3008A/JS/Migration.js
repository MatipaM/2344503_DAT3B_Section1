It is considered a much cheaper and easier option than running outdated software in a new environment. (Rubio and Wharton, 2020). Migration is challenging because of how relational digital artwork is. A digital piece is created with software, hardware and code requirements being met. When that piece is moved to a different environment, the software and/or the hardware may change and the new machine may not be able to read the old code.");
