    <p>Digital objects “must keep multiplying” (Rubio and Wharton, 2020). When an object is migrated from an older environment to a newer more stable environment. It is a copy of the original unless it has been deleted from the original environment. Then it is advisable to back up the digital work to the cloud where it will be stored on a remote server, thereby creating another copy. If you would like to share this work with someone else, you would create another copy and send that to them. Each time you create a new copy of a digital work you are prolonging its chance of survival. In the case a copy (or even the original) is corrupted, you can retrieve a prior copy. Hence why, Rubio and Wharton insist that in order to preserve a digital work, it needs to keep multiplying.	</p>

<p> The ability of digital artworks to survive bit rotting and aging hardware is dependent on their keeper’s ability to maintain them as “eternally circulating objects” (Rubio and Wharton, 2020). As a result of the object’s constant movement, the content of the object begins to change. Each copy produced becomes slightly different to that of the original. In the art world one variation in a piece, “can be sufficient to call into question the value of meaning of a given object” (Rubio and Wharton, 2020). Subtle changes in an artwork, even those which are unintended effects of migration will play a part in how viewers see the piece.</p>

<p>Authenticity in the art world is defined as “the same thing that was originally produced” (Rubio and Wharton, 2020). Authenticity is heavily linked with the originality, hence the object is seen as authentic if it is the same as the original produced. The copies required to keep the digital copy alive are seen as inauthentic. They are sometimes even seen as “betraying ‘the medium specificity’” as was seen when the exhibition, ‘Andy Warhol, Motion Pictures’ (1997) took place at MoMA (Museum of Modern Art). Critics complained that the digitised copies did not contain the same grain as the 16mm camera on which they were originally shot in 1997 (Rubio and Wharton, 2020).</p>
